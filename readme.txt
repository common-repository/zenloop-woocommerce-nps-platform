zenloop for WooCommerce is the official [zenloop.com](https://zenloop.com) plugin. It connects zenloop’s Net Promoter Score (NPS) platform with your WooCommerce shop.

== Description ==

All companies lose customers. In general, more than 15% of transactions are affected – every month. We boost customer loyalty at leading e-commerce companies.

The zenloop plugin for WooCommerce automates three key business processes:
1. Immediately detect unhappy, churning customers
2. Detect churn motives and alert stakeholders
3. Win back customers through personalized actions

By analyzing quantitative and qualitative feedback, we uncover potential for improvement and help you address the voices of (un)happy customers, increase CLV, and prevent churn. Ask your customers two simple questions, learn about their opinions on your company and take customer experience to the next level.

= What is the Net Promoter Score (NPS)? =
The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is the most popular method to measure feedback and customer loyalty. NPS correlates with revenue growth and is used by ⅔ of Fortune 1000 companies in the US. More details on the methodology can be found here.

= How do I open a zenloop account? =
Go to zenloop’s homepage: [www.zenloop.com](https://www.zenloop.com) and click on “Test zenloop” to get to the register page.
Just enter your company credentials and click “Create account”.

= When will the delivery survey email be sent? =
We send our email to survey your delivery 5 days after an order. You can adapt that timing within the code.

= Can I customize the survey design? =
Yes, you can customize your survey. Pls go to zenloop and open the “Unterstand” section. Choose your survey and click on “Edit survey”. You can customize a new survey by choosing “our email” or “website embedded” as a survey channel within the “Listen” section.

= Can I customize the survey question? =
Yes and no. You can change the question subject. However, it is important to stick to the NPS question methodology: “How likely would you recommend [brand / process] to a friend or colleague?” Why? Because the question type “Would you recommend XYZ to a friend?” aims to measure customer loyalty. People only recommend a brand/service, if they are satisfied and emotionally connected with it. If both is true, they become loyal customers.

= It’s not working =
If you have problems with the zenloop for WooCommerce data sync, and have already tried to delete and reinstall the plugin, there are a few other possible causes:

- Your setup doesn't meet the minimum requirements. The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress requires PHP 7 or greater. We also recommend you update to the latest version of WooCommerce.

- You have conflicts with your Wordpress Theme or other plugins. You may need to switch themes, or deactivate all plugins except WooCommerce and zenloop for WooCommerce, and try again. To learn more, hop over to WooCommerce: [Fixing Theme and Plugin Conflicts](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/fixing-theme-plugin-conflicts/).

If you've tried our troubleshooting suggestions, but still have trouble with your sync, contact [zenloop support](mailto:hello@zenloop.com). IMPORTANT: Please include the status report of your  WooCommerce System and screenshots of your zenloop for WooCommerce plugin settings tab.
